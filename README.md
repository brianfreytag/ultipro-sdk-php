# Ultipro SDK for PHP (Unofficial)

This is an unofficial library to allow seamless connections to Ultipro's REST API via PHP.

This library was created because Ultimate Software does not have any SDK and none of their documentation lay out how to
use PHP for any of it. 

## Installation

```
composer require brianfreytag/ultipro-sdk-php
```

## Usage
